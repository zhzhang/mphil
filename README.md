The main evaluation script is entailment.py
Run
```
~$ python entailment.py -h
```
to view the parameters and settings.

Matrices must be in the directory format generated by https://github.com/zhzhang/density-matrix-generator
The script expects entailment data to be a pickled list of tuples (concept, relatum, class, relation) generated by reading BLESS data. See read_bless.py for an example.
